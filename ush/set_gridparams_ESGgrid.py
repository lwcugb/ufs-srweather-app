    # For a ESGgrid-type grid, the orography filtering is performed by pass-
    # ing to the orography filtering the parameters for an "equivalent" glo-
    # bal uniform cubed-sphere grid.  These are the parameters that a global
    # uniform cubed-sphere grid needs to have in order to have a nominal
    # grid cell size equal to that of the (average) cell size on the region-
    # al grid.  These globally-equivalent parameters include a resolution
    # (in units of number of cells in each of the two horizontal directions)
    # and a stretch factor.  The equivalent resolution is calculated in the
    # script that generates the grid, and the stretch factor needs to be set
    # to 1 because we are considering an equivalent globally UNIFORM grid.
    # However, it turns out that with a non-symmetric regional grid (one in
    # which nx is not equal to ny), setting stretch_factor to 1 fails be-
    # cause the orography filtering program is designed for a global cubed-
    # sphere grid and thus assumes that nx and ny for a given tile are equal
    # when stretch_factor is exactly equal to 1.
    # ^^-- Why is this?  Seems like symmetry btwn x and y should still hold when the stretch factor is not equal to 1.
    # It turns out that the program will work if we set stretch_factor to a
    # value that is not exactly 1.  This is what we do below.
